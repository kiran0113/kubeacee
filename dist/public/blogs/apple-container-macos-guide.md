## Introduction

As a developer working on macOS, especially with Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4) machines, you've probably experienced the overhead of running Docker Desktop ‚Äî from high memory usage to sluggish startup times, not to mention the occasional resource conflicts.

Well, not anymore.

Apple has quietly released a revolutionary **native container runtime** called `container` that allows developers to run Linux containers directly on macOS using Apple's own [Containerization framework](https://github.com/apple/containerization). It works natively without needing Docker Desktop or a VM backend, and delivers impressive performance improvements while maintaining compatibility with standard OCI images.

Today, I tried `container` for the first time, and here's what I discovered:

- **Sub-second startup times** üöÄ
- **Native Apple Silicon optimization** ‚ö°
- **Familiar Docker-like syntax** üë®‚Äçüíª
- **Advanced networking capabilities** üåê
- **Dramatically lower resource usage** üßº
- **Seamless OCI compatibility** üí°

In this comprehensive guide, I'll walk you through everything you need to know about **transitioning from Docker to Apple's `container`**, including detailed command comparisons, advanced features, troubleshooting tips, and a complete migration strategy.

## System Requirements

Before diving in, ensure your system meets these critical requirements:

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| **Hardware** | Apple Silicon Mac (M1/M2/M3/M4) - Intel Macs are **not supported** |
| **OS (Recommended)** | macOS 26 Beta 1 or newer for full functionality |
| **OS (Minimum)** | macOS 15 with significant limitations |
| **Xcode** | Xcode 26 Beta (if building from source) |

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical**: While `container` runs on macOS 15, Apple's maintainers primarily support macOS 26 Beta. **Networking features are severely limited on macOS 15**, impacting container-to-container communication.

---

## Technical Architecture: How It Works

Apple's `container` uses a fundamentally different approach compared to Docker Desktop:

### Under the Hood
- **Lightweight Virtual Machines**: Each container runs in its own optimized VM using Apple's Virtualization.framework
- **Dedicated IP Addresses**: Containers receive their own IP addresses, often eliminating port forwarding needs
- **Optimized Linux Kernel**: Uses a minimal, fast-booting kernel configuration achieving sub-second startup times
- **vminitd Init System**: A lightweight init system providing GRPC API over vsock for efficient process management
- **Rosetta 2 Integration**: Seamlessly runs x86_64 containers on Apple Silicon using Apple's translation layer
- **Native Swift Implementation**: Built entirely in Swift for optimal macOS integration

### Performance Comparison

| Metric | Docker Desktop | Apple `container` |
|--------|----------------|-------------------|
| **Cold start time** | 3-5 seconds | **<1 second** |
| **Memory overhead** | 500MB-2GB | **<200MB** |
| **CPU usage (idle)** | 5-15% | **<2%** |
| **Boot time** | 10-30 seconds | **2-5 seconds** |
| **Image pull speed** | Standard | **Optimized for Apple Silicon** |

---

## Command Comparison: Docker vs `container`

The syntax is intentionally similar to Docker, making migration straightforward:

### Basic Operations

| Action | Docker | `container` |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Pull an image** | `docker pull nginx` | `container image pull nginx` |
| **Run a container** | `docker run -d --name web -p 8080:80 nginx` | `container run --detach --name web --publish 8080:80 nginx` |
| **List containers** | `docker ps` | `container ps` |
| **List all containers** | `docker ps -a` | `container ps -a` |
| **Stop a container** | `docker stop web` | `container stop web` |
| **Remove a container** | `docker rm web` | `container rm web` |
| **View logs** | `docker logs web` | `container logs web` |
| **Execute into container** | `docker exec -it web sh` | `container exec -it web sh` |

### Advanced Operations

| Action | Docker | `container` |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Restart policy** | `docker run --restart on-failure:5 [...]` | `container run --restart on-failure:5 [...]` |
| **Environment variables** | `docker run -e VAR=value nginx` | `container run -e VAR=value nginx` |
| **Volume mounting** | `docker run -v /host:/container nginx` | `container run -v /host:/container nginx` |
| **Image management** | `docker images` | `container image list` |
| **Remove image** | `docker rmi nginx` | `container image rm nginx` |
| **Image tagging** | `docker tag nginx my-nginx` | `container image tag nginx my-nginx` |

> ‚úÖ **Migration Tip**: Most Docker commands have direct equivalents, making the transition seamless for existing workflows.

## Advanced Networking Features

One of `container`'s most impressive features is its sophisticated networking approach:

### Network Capabilities by macOS Version

| Feature | macOS 15 | macOS 26 Beta |
|---------|----------|---------------|
| **Container-to-host communication** | ‚úÖ Full support | ‚úÖ Full support |
| **Port forwarding to host** | ‚úÖ Full support | ‚úÖ Full support |
| **Container-to-container communication** | ‚ùå **Severely limited** | ‚úÖ **Full support** |
| **Dedicated container IPs** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited | ‚úÖ **Full support** |
| **Network isolation** | Basic | Advanced |

### Networking Examples

**Traditional approach (works on all versions):**
```bash
# Standard port forwarding
container run --detach --name web1 --publish 8080:80 nginx
container run --detach --name web2 --publish 8081:80 nginx
```

**Advanced networking (macOS 26 Beta):**
```bash
# Containers get dedicated IPs - no port conflicts!
container run --detach --name web1 nginx
container run --detach --name web2 nginx
container run --detach --name api nodejs-app

# Direct container-to-container communication
container exec web1 ping web2
container exec api curl http://web1/api/health
```

## Installation & Getting Started

### Step 1: Download and Install

1. Visit the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/apple/container/releases)
2. Download the latest `.pkg` installer
3. Double-click to install (requires administrator password)
4. Files are installed to `/usr/local/`

**Verify installation:**
```bash
container --version
# Expected output: container version 1.0.0
```

### Step 2: Your First Container

Let's start with a simple Nginx example:

```bash
# Pull the image
container image pull nginx

# Run with port forwarding
container run --detach --name myweb --publish 8080:80 nginx

# Check if it's running
container ps
```

**Access your application:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8080
# or open in browser: http://localhost:8080
```

### Step 3: Explore Container Management

```bash
# View logs
container logs myweb

# Execute commands inside container
container exec -it myweb bash

# Stop and clean up
container stop myweb
container rm myweb
```

## Image Building and Management

### OCI Image Operations

While `container` doesn't build from Dockerfiles, it excels at OCI image management:

```bash
# Pull different architectures
container image pull --platform linux/arm64 nginx:alpine
container image pull --platform linux/amd64 nginx:alpine

# Tag and push to registries
container image tag nginx:alpine my-registry.com/nginx:v1.0
container image push my-registry.com/nginx:v1.0

# List and inspect images
container image list
container image inspect nginx:alpine

# Clean up unused images
container image prune
```

### Interoperability with Docker

Seamlessly share images between Docker and `container`:

```bash
# Export from Docker to container
docker save myapp:latest | container image load

# Export from container to Docker
container image save myapp:latest | docker load

# Build with Docker, run with container
docker build -t myapp:dev .
docker save myapp:dev | container image load
container run --detach --name myapp-test myapp:dev
```

### Performance Optimization Tips

```bash
# Use ARM64 images when available
container image pull --platform linux/arm64 postgres:15

# Clean up regularly
container container prune  # remove stopped containers
container image prune     # remove unused images

# Use restart policies for critical services
container run --restart unless-stopped --name db postgres:15

# Monitor resource usage
container stats  # real-time resource usage
```

## Advanced Features

### Container Restart Policies

```bash
# Always restart (similar to Docker)
container run --restart always --name web nginx

# Restart on failure with limit
container run --restart on-failure:3 --name api myapi:latest

# Restart unless manually stopped
container run --restart unless-stopped --name db postgres:15
```

### Environment Variables and Secrets

```bash
# Single environment variable
container run -e NODE_ENV=production myapp:latest

# Multiple variables
container run \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  -e DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@db:5432/myapp \
  -e REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379 \
  myapp:latest

# Environment file (create .env file first)
container run --env-file .env myapp:latest
```

### Volume Management

```bash
# Bind mount
container run -v /host/path:/container/path nginx

# Named volumes (stored in container's data directory)
container run -v mydata:/data postgres:15

# Read-only mounts
container run -v /host/config:/app/config:ro myapp:latest
```
