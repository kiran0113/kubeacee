Fear not! In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of installing and configuring Jitsi Meet on Ubuntu 22.04, empowering you to host your own secure and reliable video conferencing platform.

### Preparing Your Environment

Before diving into the installation process, it's crucial to ensure that your Ubuntu 22.04 server is up-to-date and equipped with the necessary packages. Here's what you'll need:

- **gnupg2**
- **nginx-full**
- **sudo** (if not already installed)
- **curl** (or **wget**)

### Installation Steps

#### 1. Update Packages and Repositories

Ensure your system is up-to-date and supports HTTPS for repository access:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install apt-transport-https
sudo apt-add-repository universe
sudo apt update
```

#### 2. Set Up DNS for Your Server

Decide on a domain for your Jitsi Meet instance and configure a DNS A record accordingly in your DNS provider 

#### 3. Configure Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN) (Optional)

If you have an FQDN set up, configure it using the following commands:

```bash
sudo hostnamectl set-hostname meet.kubeace.com

```

Add the following line:

```

```

echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/prosody-debian-packages.key] http://packages.prosody.im/debian $(lsb_release -sc) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/prosody-debian-packages.list
sudo apt install lua5.2

curl -sL https://download.jitsi.org/jitsi-key.gpg.key | sudo sh -c 'gpg --dearmor > /usr/share/keyrings/jitsi-keyring.gpg'
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jitsi-keyring.gpg] https://download.jitsi.org stable/" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jitsi-stable.list
```

#### 5. Install Jitsi Meet
