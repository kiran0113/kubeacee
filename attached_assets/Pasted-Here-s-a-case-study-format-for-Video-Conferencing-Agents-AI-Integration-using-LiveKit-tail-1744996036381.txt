## 📘 **Case Study: Video Conferencing Agents & AI Integration Using LiveKit**

### 🏢 **Client Background**
A rapidly growing telehealth startup that connects patients with health professionals across regions. They wanted to scale to thousands of consultations per day while integrating AI-driven assistance and automating triage tasks using real-time video conferencing.

---

### 🎯 **Objective**
To build a scalable and interactive video conferencing platform that:
- Connects users to live agents (health professionals).
- Integrates AI for pre-consultation triage and live transcription.
- Handles 5000+ concurrent sessions and 450,000 sessions per day.
- Supports dynamic agent routing, session recording, and metrics tracking.

---

### 🛠️ **Technology Stack**
- **Video Conferencing:** [LiveKit](https://livekit.io/) (self-hosted)
- **Frontend:** React.js + TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Node.js + Express
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI / Vertex AI for NLP & Triage
- **Voice-to-Text:** Whisper (OpenAI) or Deepgram
- **Authentication:** Auth0 / Firebase Auth
- **Monitoring:** Grafana + Prometheus + Loki
- **Infrastructure:** Kubernetes (EKS), Redis, PostgreSQL
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions + ArgoCD

---

### ⚙️ **Architecture Overview**

#### 🔹 1. **User Onboarding & Agent Matching**
- Users initiate a request via frontend.
- Backend triggers matchmaking to assign the right agent based on availability, specialization, and load.

#### 🔹 2. **AI-Powered Pre-Session**
- Before connecting to an agent, an **AI triage bot** gathers initial info.
- AI summarizes symptoms or queries, which are then passed to the agent for context.

#### 🔹 3. **LiveKit Room Initialization**
- A new LiveKit room is created dynamically.
- Both agent and user join via unique tokens.
- Optional: AI assistant joins silently to transcribe and summarize in real-time.

#### 🔹 4. **Session Features**
- Real-time **transcription and summarization**.
- **Recording & compliance logging**.
- On-screen tools for drawing, file sharing, and chat.
- AI nudges for the agent (“Suggest asking about past medication,” etc.)

#### 🔹 5. **Post-Session Automation**
- AI generates a session summary.
- Stores data securely in a HIPAA-compliant database.
- Feedback forms and follow-up scheduling.

### 🚀 **Key Achievements**
| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Concurrent Sessions | 500 | 5,000+ |
| Daily Sessions | ~25,000 | 450,000 |
| Avg. Wait Time | ~4 mins | < 30 seconds |
| Agent Efficiency | — | +37% via AI pre-triage |
| Session Logs/Transcripts | Manual | Fully Automated |

---

### 🧠 **AI Integration Highlights**
- **Pre-session triage** reduced agent time by ~40%.
- **Live transcription** increased accuracy for records.
- **AI co-pilot for agents** suggested follow-up questions in real-time.
- **Smart session summarizer** helped with legal documentation.

---

### 📉 **Challenges & Solutions**
| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Session scale-out under heavy load | Auto-scaling LiveKit nodes using Karpenter on EKS |
| AI delays during triage | Batched processing and caching frequent responses |
| Handling low-bandwidth users | Dynamic video quality adjustment using LiveKit's simulcast |
| Session routing latency | Redis-based distributed queue for agent availability |

---

### ✅ **Outcome**
The platform was able to handle high-volume video calls with minimal latency, reduced operational costs through AI automation, and significantly enhanced the end-user experience with contextual, real-time AI support.

---

### 🔮 **Next Steps**
- Multilingual AI support
- SIP integration for PSTN calls
- Predictive agent routing using ML
- Auto-summarized EHR entries post-session
