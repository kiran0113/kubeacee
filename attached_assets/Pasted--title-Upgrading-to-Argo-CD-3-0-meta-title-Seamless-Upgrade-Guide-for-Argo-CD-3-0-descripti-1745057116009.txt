## What's New in Argo CD 3.0?

### 0. Breaking Changes (Important!)
Before diving into the new features, be aware of these critical changes:
- **Minimum Kubernetes Version**: Now requires Kubernetes 1.21+
- **Redis Removal**: Redis dependency has been completely removed
- **Deprecated APIs**: Several deprecated APIs have been removed
- **Configuration Changes**: Some configuration fields have been renamed or restructured

### 1. Simplified Configuration
The Argo community has streamlined configuration management, removing redundant settings and deprecating outdated fields. This ensures cleaner, more consistent manifests across teams.

### 2. Enhanced Performance
Performance improvements are among the most exciting changes:
- **Faster Sync Operations**: Syncs are now up to 40% faster due to optimized resource reconciliation.
- **Reduced Memory Usage**: The application controller has been refactored to consume less memory, particularly beneficial in large-scale environments.

### 3. Improved UI/UX
The user interface has been significantly enhanced:
- **Dark Mode**: A highly requested feature, dark mode improves readability in low-light environments.
- **Customizable Dashboards**: Users can now create personalized dashboards to monitor specific applications or clusters.

### 4. Security Enhancements
Security remains a top priority for the community:
- **RBAC Improvements**: Fine-grained role-based access control (RBAC) policies now allow more granular permissions.
- **Secret Management**: Integration with external secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault has been enhanced.

### 5. API Versioning
The introduction of **versioned APIs** ensures stability and future-proofing, making breaking changes easier to manage in subsequent releases.

### 6. Resource Health Assessment
The community has improved resource health assessment with:
- Better handling of custom resources
- More accurate status reporting for managed resources
- Enhanced health check customization options

### 7. Application Set Improvements
- Enhanced progressive syncs
- Better handling of matrix generators
- Improved error reporting and validation

## Challenges During the Upgrade Process

While upgrading to Argo CD 3.0 brings many benefits, it also comes with challenges. Here are some common hurdles and how to address them:

### 1. Backwards Compatibility
Ensuring backwards compatibility was a major focus for the community. However, some legacy configurations may no longer be supported. Carefully review your existing setup and update deprecated features before upgrading.

### 2. Deprecation of Legacy Features
Several features from 2.14 have been deprecated, including:
- The `argo-cd-util` CLI tool, replaced by native kubectl plugins.
- Support for older Kubernetes versions (pre-1.21).

### 3. Performance Bottlenecks
Early adopters reported performance bottlenecks in large-scale deployments. The community addressed these by:
- Refactoring the application controller to handle concurrent operations more efficiently.
- Optimizing database queries to reduce latency.

## What Changed from 2.14?

Here's a summary of the most notable changes between Argo CD 2.14 and 3.0:

## Pre-Upgrade Checklist

Before starting the upgrade, ensure you:

1. **Back Up Your Data**

```bash
kubectl get applications -A -o yaml > applications-backup.yaml
kubectl get appprojects -A -o yaml > projects-backup.yaml
```

2. **Check Kubernetes Version**  
   Verify your cluster runs Kubernetes 1.21 or later.

3. **Review Custom Resources**
   - Check for any custom health checks.
   - Validate custom resource definitions.
   - Review application set configurations.

4. **Verify Resource Requirements**  
   The new version has different resource requirements:
   - Removed Redis dependency.
   - Changed memory allocation patterns.
   - Updated CPU requirements for controllers.

## Backwards Compatibility & Migration

Migrating from 2.14 to 3.0 requires careful planning to ensure a smooth transition. Here’s how you can approach it:

### 1. Review Deprecated Features
Before upgrading, review the list of deprecated features and update your configurations accordingly. Refer to the [official migration guide](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/operator-manual/upgrading/2.14-3.0/) for detailed instructions.

### 2. Test in a Staging Environment
Always test the upgrade in a staging environment before applying it to production. This helps identify potential issues early and ensures minimal disruption.

### 3. Use Automated Tools
To simplify the migration process, use the following tools:

- **Argo CD CLI**: Run `argocd admin migrate` to automatically update your manifests.
- **Helm Charts**: If you're using Helm, update your chart version to `5.x` (compatible with 3.0).

### 4. Monitor Post-Upgrade
After upgrading, closely monitor your applications and infrastructure. Pay attention to:
- Sync statuses.
- Resource utilization.
- Logs for any errors or warnings.
