### Introduction

In the realm of virtual meetings and remote collaboration, Jitsi Meet has emerged as a versatile and user-friendly solution. However, understanding how it all comes together can be a bit like unraveling a mystery. In this detailed guide, we'll take an in-depth look at the inner workings of Jitsi Meet, including its core components, recording and transcription capabilities, and how KubeAce can provide commercial support and customization for setting up scalable Jitsi deployments.

### How It All Fits Together:

Imagine you're hosting a virtual meeting using Jitsi Meet. As participants join, their audio and video streams are seamlessly routed through the Jitsi Videobridge, ensuring everyone can see and hear each other clearly. Meanwhile, Jicofo manages the flow of the meeting, ensuring smooth interactions and optimal performance. If someone needs to join via a traditional phone line, Jigasi steps in to facilitate the connection. And if you've enabled recording or transcription, Jibri quietly works in the background, capturing every moment for future reference.
